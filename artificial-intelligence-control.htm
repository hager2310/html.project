<i><p style="font-size:160%;color:White;">- Artificial Intelligence Control
<i><p style="font-size:115%;color:White;">The takeover of artificial intelligence is a scenario that assumes that artificial intelligence (AI) will become the dominant type of intelligence on Earth, with computers or robots effectively taking control of a planet away from the human race. Possible scenarios include the replacement of the entire human workforce by the forces of artificial intelligence, and the application of the popular notion of a possible robot uprising. Some public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have called for the initiation of precautionary measures to ensure that the future of artificial intelligence and machines remains under human control. [1] Robot revolutions have been a major topic in science fiction for many decades, but despite this, the science fiction scenarios in this regard are generally very different from those of concern to scientists.
